# Personal Portfolio Website

This repository contains a demo of my **personal portfolio website**, which I developed while practicing and strengthening my WordPress development skills.

## Project Overview

- **Purpose:** Practice project to improve my WordPress and Elementor skills.
- **Built From Scratch:** No pre-made themes were used â€” the layout and structure were created from scratch, inspired by a design I found online.
- **Technologies:** WordPress CMS, Elementor page builder.

##  Features

- Custom layout designed and built entirely with Elementor.
- Clean and responsive design.
- Sections include Home,Projects, and About.

##  Demo

This site is hosted locally and not deployed online, so this repository contains only demo file for portfolio reference.
